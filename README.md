## **_Introduction_** 🐸

**_Welcome to Python!🪂_**

_Python is a high-level programming language, with applications in numerous areas, including web programming, scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence._
_It is very popular and used by organizations such as Google, NASA, the CIA, and Disney._

> _Python was created by **👉 Guido Van Rossum:octocat:** in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation._
> _Python was named for Monty Python's Flying Circus(British surreal sketch series created by comedy group
Monty Python's or Team Python's) A.K.A pythons._
> _Guido van rossum wanted to create his first programmimg  language more easy(people can fun with codes)
and same time very powerful._

**_Versions Of Python🕷_**

_The three major versions of Python are 1.x, 2.x and 3.x. These are subdivided into minor versions, such as 2.7 and 3.3._
_Code written for Python 3.x is guaranteed to work in all future versions._
_Both Python Version 2.x and 3.x are used currently._
_It isn't hard to change from one version to another._

**_Software/Editor To Run Codes:🛩_**

1. **_Eclipse PyDev PlugIn_**
2. **_Spyder_**
3. **_Visual Studio Code_**
4. **_Atom/Atom IDE_**
5. **_Pycharm_**
6. **_Sublime Text_**
7. **_Jupyter_**

## **_Datatypes_** 🦗

_Data type tells what type of data a variable can carry._
_We create a variable for example,_
           **_a = 10_**
_That means, a can carry numeric or integer type data._
   
_Similarly, if we assign **f = 10.23** that means, f can hold onto floating point or decimal type of data._

 **_s = "Python is a powerful programming language_"**
_And If we assigned set of characters within double quotes to a variable called S That means, s is of type string that is it can hold a sequences of  characters or a string type._ 

**_In Python Datatypes Mainly Organized Into Five Types:👇_**

1. **_None Type:_** _an object does not contain any value_
2. **_Numeric Type:_** _int,float,complex_
3. **_Sequences:_** _str,bytes,bytearray,list,tuple,range_
4. **_Sets:_** _Does not allow duplicates_
5. **_Mapping:_** _which can use map and reduce_

**_In my Pythonista repo, I've uploaded a folder name to " learn python ":snake:, in this folder, I'm gonna upload all topics based on basic codes for understanding the concept of the topic which wanna need to learn.☺🗽🚀_**
