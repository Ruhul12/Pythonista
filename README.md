## Introduction 🐸

__Welcome to Python!__

_Python is a high-level programming language, with applications in numerous areas, including web programming, scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence._
_It is very popular and used by organizations such as Google, NASA, the CIA, and Disney._

> Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.
> Python was named for Monty Python's Flying Circus(British surreal sketch series created by comedy group
Monty Python's or Team Python's) A.K.A pythons.
> Guido van rossum wanted to create his first programmimg  language more easy(people can fun with codes)
and same time very powerful.

__Versions Of Python__

_The three major versions of Python are 1.x, 2.x and 3.x. These are subdivided into minor versions, such as 2.7 and 3.3._
_Code written for Python 3.x is guaranteed to work in all future versions._
_Both Python Version 2.x and 3.x are used currently._
_It isn't hard to change from one version to another._

## Datatypes 🦗

__In Python Datatypes Mainly Organized Into Five Types__

1. _None Type: an object does not contain any value_
2. Numeric Type: int,float,complex
3. Sequences : str,bytes,bytearray,list,tuple,range
4. Sets : Does not allow duplicates
5. Mapping : which can use map and reduce
