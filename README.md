## Introduction 🐸

__Welcome to Python!__

_Python is a high-level programming language, with applications in numerous areas, including web programming, scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence._
_It is very popular and used by organizations such as Google, NASA, the CIA, and Disney._

> Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.
> Python was named for Monty Python's Flying Circus(British surreal sketch series created by comedy group
Monty Python's or Team Python's) A.K.A pythons.
> Guido van rossum wanted to create his first programmimg  language more easy(people can fun with codes)
and same time very powerful.

__Versions Of Python__

_The three major versions of Python are 1.x, 2.x and 3.x. These are subdivided into minor versions, such as 2.7 and 3.3._
_Code written for Python 3.x is guaranteed to work in all future versions._
_Both Python Version 2.x and 3.x are used currently._
_It isn't hard to change from one version to another._

__Software For Run Codes:__

1. **Atom/Atom IDE**
2. **Spyder**
3. **Jupyter**
4. **Eclipse PyDev PlugIn**
5. **Pycharm**

## Datatypes 🦗

__In Python Datatypes Mainly Organized Into Five Types:👇__

1. **_None Type:_** _an object does not contain any value_
2. **_Numeric Type:_** _int,float,complex_
3. **_Sequences:_** _str,bytes,bytearray,list,tuple,range_
4. **_Sets:_** _Does not allow duplicates_
5. **_Mapping:_** _which can use map and reduce_
